# Content Providers

## What are Content Providers?
Content Providers manage access to a structured set of data, such as contacts or media files.
They can be used to share data between apps.
Purpose: Manage and share app data with other apps. They provide a structured mechanism for accessing and modifying data.
Example: Accessing the device's contacts, calendar events, or media files.
Data Access: Use a standardized interface (ContentResolver) to interact with content providers, allowing for data sharing between different apps in a secure and controlled manner.
