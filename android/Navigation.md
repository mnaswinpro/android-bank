# Navigation


## Different ways to navigate in a large code base (multi modular) architecture
1. Single activity with multiple fragments using navigation 
2. Multiple activities in modules and using deeplink defined in Manifest
3. Router pattern implemented at app level using dependency injection and navigation through dependencies added in modules
4. Feature graphs inside Main graph - not good for navigating to activities
